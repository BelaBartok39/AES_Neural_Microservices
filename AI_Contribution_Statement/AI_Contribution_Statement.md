## AI Contribution Statement

For this project, I used Claude Sonnet 4, provided by Anthropic, to assist with coding and documentation tasks. The AI was employed to generate 
code snippets, clarify technical concepts, and aid in the drafting of documentation. All prompts, responses, and relevant logs are documented 
and can be found in the folder labeled "ChatLogs," which contains records of all interactions and dates of use.
